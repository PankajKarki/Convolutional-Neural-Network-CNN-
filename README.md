# Convolutional-Neural-Network-(CNN)


#### Apply different Convolutional Neural Network ( CNN ) architectures on MNIST dataset which is inbuilt in Keras library .MNIST dataset contains images of all hand - written digits from 0 to 9 . our task is to classify them all by using various architectures of convolutional neural networks.

### Objective:
Build various CNN architectures for MNIST dataset.

Data Source: You can load data from this library(from keras.datasets import mnist)
